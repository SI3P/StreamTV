## Server (Desktop)

The Multimodal Server Architecture takes multimodal inputs and merge them into a semantic frame using different grammars:

- the interpreter controls the life cycle of each modality and realizes the multimodal fusion;
- each mode recognizes the input signals and notifies the results through an event;
- the recognized sequences are placed in a multidimensional stream to be integrated into a single multimodal frame;
- the application receives the frames and generates a feedback for the user.
