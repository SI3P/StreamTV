The Multimodal Server Architecture takes multimodal inputs and merge them into a semantic frame using different grammars:

- The interpreter controls the life cycle of each modality and realizes the multimodal fusion
- Each mode recognizes the input signals and notifies the results through an event
- The recognized sequences are placed in a multidimensional stream to be integrated into a single multimodal frame


 The application receives the frames and generates a feedback for the user.
