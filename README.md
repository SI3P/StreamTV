The Multimodal Server Architecture takes multimodal inputs and merge them into a semantic frame using different grammars:

- fusion Agent controls the life cycle of modalities and realizes the multimodal presentation
- each modality recognizes and interprets the input and notify the semantic information 
- semantic features are placed into a buffer periodically checked by a monitor
